			<h3>Dublin SPCA Animal Rehoming and Rescue Centre</h3>
			<p>The Dublin SPCA is very proud of its campus on Mount Venus Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin 16.  
			We are located in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains.  
			The campus is a very short drive from Marley Park and the M50.</p>

			<p>You are more than welcome to visit our animal rescue and rehoming centre.</p>
			<p>You can view the location and opening hours on our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
			<p>Opened in 2003, it is a state of the art facility offering shelter and care to a wide 
			variety of animals including dogs, cats, horses, donkeys, goats, cows, pigs, rabbits, 
			ferrets, gerbils, budgies, snakes, terripins and all manner of farmyard fowl.</p>
			<p>The rescue and rehoming centre is also a rest stop for a number of injured and 
			young wildlife awaiting release including swans, foxes, badgers, hedgehogs and small birds</p>
			<p>The areas on public view include the stables, paddocks and grazing pastures, 
			the dog kennels, cattery, small animal sections, pig play area, goat and fowl areas and 
			entry to the centre is free. All these areas are a big hit with children.</p>
			<p>We have a cafe in the centre called the &#34;Central Bark Cafe&#34; and a gift and pet supplies shop. 
			People can sit and relax after visiting the rescue and rehoming centre, meet our Adoption 
			Consultants, buy cat and dog food and other pet accessories; we also sell items for adults, kids and the home.</p>
			<p>School groups, community groups, summer recreation programs, church groups and any other 
			interested groups can set up a time for a tour of the Dublin SPCA animal rescue and rehoming 
			centre which includes introductory video and discussion session in our lecture room followed 
			by a tour of the centre.</p>
			<p>Behind the scene we have isolation facilities housing sick and injured dogs and cats, veterinary
			inspection units, pre and post operative veterinary wings and two state of the art operating theaters.</p>
			<p>The campus can be reached by car or by bus 15b to Stocking Lane.  
			Please note there are no footpaths on Mount Venus road so we recommend caution 
			if walking from the bus stop on Stocking Lane.</p>
